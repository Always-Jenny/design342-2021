        <p>The market for Beanie Babies remains volatile with many peaks and valleys. While a rare, original Valentino Beanie Babies (style 4058 from 1993) sold for $10,000 in 2013, there are many counterfeit and restored toys in the Beanie Babies camp too. Valentino is one of the most valuable of the Beanie Baby bears. If you own a rare version with an error, you may be sitting on tens of thousands of dollars. In January 2019, a Valentino with every error (brown nose instead of black, white star on the tag instead of yellow, PVC pellets, and multiple typos on the tag) sold on eBay for $42,300.
